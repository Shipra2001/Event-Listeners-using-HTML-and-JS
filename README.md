# Event-Listeners-using-HTML-and-JS
This code creates a webpage with buttons that change color on click, display messages on hover, hide messages on mouseout, and disappear on double-click using JavaScript event listeners.

HTML Structure: The HTML file includes three buttons, each with an associated div to display a message. The buttons have unique ids for identification.

JavaScript Code:

changeColor: Changes the button color to light blue when clicked.

showMessage: Displays a message near the button when the mouse is over it

hideMessage: Hides the message when the mouse is moved away from the button.

hideButton: Hides the button when double-clicked.

Event listeners are added to each button for the specified events (click, mouseover, mouseout, dblclick)
